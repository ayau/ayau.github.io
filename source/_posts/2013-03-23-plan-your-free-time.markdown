Sitar - Saturday Lunch

Working on my app, bother him with new feature and design

Roommate

- How do you have so much free time?

More classes

You work all the time

But I'm not very efficient

Well what will you do if you have no work for today

Oh I don't know.

Chill for 10 mins, practice piano for 30 mins, jam with band for 30 mins, go to Gym. Read game of thrones for 30 mins

2 hours of time. Then I don't know what to do.

4 hours of work, with procrastination, spread out, consumes entire day


That's the problem, you don't know what to do with your free time so you don't feel the need to do work efficiently and finish early

How I do it -
(not recommended)
Schedule free time - 

Improve skills, not procrastination

Because what happens work - procrastinate (imgur, email, facebook) - work


Free time first before work.

If work before free time, allow yourself freedom to procrastinate by sacrificing free time afterwards

- Pressure, good motivation tool

Result - 
Hobbies enjoyed
Skills developed
Work efficiency increases


-----

You do same amount of stuff/work depending on how much is scheduled.
